## How to Launch the Application

To successfully run this application, you need to follow these steps:
Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

### Step 1: Create a `.env` File

Before launching the application, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will hold important configuration settings, including default admin credentials and the Flask environment mode.

Hereâ€™s a template for your `.env` file:

```properties
DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME=xxxx
DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=xxx@xxx.xxxx
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=xxxxx

FLASK_ENV=development
```

Replace the placeholder values (`xxxx`, `xxx@xxx.xxxx`, and `xxxxx`) with your desired admin username, email, and password.

### Step 2: Build and Start the Application

Once the `.env` file is created, you can launch the application using Docker. Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located), and run the following command:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

- Build the Docker images as defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
- Start the application services.

### Step 3: Access the Application

After the containers have started, you can access the application in your web browser at:

:eyes: http://localhost:5000

### Step 4: Stopping the Application

To stop the application, you can simply press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the application is running. Alternatively, you can run:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

This command will stop and remove the containers.

### Conclusion

You are now ready to use the application! If you encounter any issues, ensure that your `.env` file is correctly configured and that all required services are running.
