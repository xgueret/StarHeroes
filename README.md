Welcome to StarHeroes! ðŸŒŸ

StarHeroes is a fun and engaging web app designed for kids to track their achievements and earn shining stars! Each week, children can showcase their awesome behavior and complete tasks, collecting stars along the way. Parents can easily customize rules, give feedback, and celebrate their little heroes' progress with colorful charts and reports.
